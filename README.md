calculator project for TOP

This is  aproject  for a basic calculator web page.

This calculator must be able to do the following :

1. add, subtract, multiply, divide.
2. the above but in continous fashion (i.e. 1 + 3 * 2 / 2 = 4)
3. allow decimal points, but only allow 1 decimal point
4. clear all data
5.display a snarky remark when someone tries to divide by 0
5. round answers that have long decimals
6. numbers should not be evaluated in more than a single pair (i.e. 1+1=2+1=3+1=4)

as according to the assignment page I will start with creating funcutions to all the basic maths, then move to getting the calculator on the html with the tags,buttons etc, then style it and finally wire the JS to the page and begin trouble shooting as need be.

I feel way in over my head right now like everything I have learned just hasn't stuck with me, this is going to be hard.

starting with JS:

created basic math funcitons, then a operate function that calls on the basic maths fucntions based on a if..else statement that calls the needed function based on the operator selected.
